# Annotation Widget Notebook

This **Notebook** will help you annotate the output of the ML Solution . The basic steps will be described below.

## Files

The csv file you want to annotate should be placed in the **/output** folder. It should contain _kpi_, _paragraph_ and _answer_ columns.
Specify the file name in the notebook
`file_name = "test_predictions_kpi.csv"`

## Run all cells

Once the file name is set, run all the cells.

If everything ran correctly, your view should be the following:

## Annotate

When you annotate you have the option to declare the answer as correct, incorrect, or partial when the paragraph only is correct.
When only the paragraph is correct you have the option to insert the correct answer inside a textbox and click enter once it is done
